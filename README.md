# niftory-kotd-cadence

This repo contains the smart contracts, supporting transactions and scripts, and test suite for the KOTD collectible experience, built on Flow.

The collectible structure is very similar to NBA Top Shot (and most card based collectibles), where collectibles will be minted in varying size runs, and belong to different sets and series over time.  Some improvements and changes have been made to the Top Shot contract, including:

-Nomenclature changes (e.g. 'Play' -> 'CollectibleItem')
-Small quality of life improvements, like named paths
-Data access improvements based off of Josh Hannan's "What Iâ€™ve learned since Top Shot" Cadence blogs
-Additional contract defined metadata at the Series, Set, and CollectibleItem level
-Functionality conveniences, such as closing all open sets & editions when starting a new Series

The official flow-js-testing library has been used for the creation of the test suite.

Much thanks to all the Dapper resouces and Discord help used in the adaptation of this contract!

| :exclamation:  This project last tested on Flow CLI v0.21.0 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|

## Running the Tests

From the root of the project:

1.  Make the test shell script executable:

    ```
    chmod +x tests.sh
    ```
    
3. Run the 'test' shell script; this starts the flow emulator, deploys contracts, runs all tests, then cleans up the emulator:
    
    ```
    ./tests.sh
    ```

## Getting Started: Development


1. Install the Flow CLI:

    ```
    brew install flow-cli
    ```

## Getting Started: Working on Tests
| :exclamation: Cadence tests are expected to run against the local emulator. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

1. Navigate to the lib/go/test path.
2. Set up your testing flow.json and .env files, per the example.flow.json and .env.example in the root directory.
3. Start a shell window in this directory and run:

    ```
    flow emulator -v
    ```
4. Open another shell window and run the following command to deploy your contracts:
    ```
    flow project deploy --network=emulator
    ```
5. Run your tests

    ```
    npm run test
    ```

#### In order to update a deployed contract, restart your emulator. You _can_ try the following command:

    flow project deploy --network=emulator --update
   
| :zap: These next areas are focused on testnet, not the local emulator. |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
## Getting Started: General Cadence Testnet Operations

1. Generate a key pair with the Flow CLI:
    ```
    flow keys generate
    ```

    | :zap: Make sure to save these keys in a safe place, you'll need them later. |
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

2. Go to the Flow Testnet Faucet to create a new testnet account. Use the public key from the previous step.

4. Set up your flow.json file, per the example.flow.json in the root directory.

You're now setup to run any desired commands against testnet.

## Common Commands
| :bulb: Contracts are already deployed to testnet - you'll generally only need to run scripts and transactions. |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

##### Deploy contract 
    
    flow project deploy --network=testnet

##### Update deployed contract
    flow project deploy --network=testnet --update

| :bulb: Only certain changes to a contract can be deployed via --update. |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|

##### Remove deployed contract
    flow accounts remove-contract KOTD --network=testnet --signer=testnet-account

##### Create Set
    flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/admin/create_set.cdc --signer testnet-account --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "String","value": "Test Set 001"}]'

##### Get Set Name
    flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get_set_name.cdc --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}]'

##### Create Collectible Item (Content)
    flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/admin/create_collectible_item.cdc --signer testnet-account --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "String","value": "Test Moment 002"}]'

##### Mint a Collectible NFT
    flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/admin/mint_collectible.cdc --signer testnet-account --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}, {"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}, {"type": "Address","value": "0x9f3e19cda04154fc"}]'

##### Add a Collectible Item to a Set
    flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/admin/add_collectible_item_to_set.cdc --signer testnet-account --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}, {"type": "UInt32","value": "2"}]'

##### Batch Mint Collectible NFTs
    flow transactions send ./cadence/transactions/admin/mint_collectibles_bulk.cdc --signer testnet-account --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}, {"type": "UInt32","value": "2"}, {"type": "UInt64","value": "10"}]'

##### Get Collectible IDs in a Collection
    flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get_collection_collectible_ids.cdc --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "Address","value": "0x9f3e19cda04154fc"}]'

##### Get Metadata for a Given Collectible Item
     flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get_collectible_item_metadata.cdc --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}]'

##### Get Serial Number for a Collectible
    flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get_collectible_serial_number.cdc --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "Address","value": "0x9f3e19cda04154fc"}, {"type": "UInt64","value": "8"}]'

##### Get the Edition Size for an Edition (Set + CollectibleItem)
    flow scripts execute ./cadence/scripts/get_edition_size.cdc --network=testnet --args-json '[{"type": "UInt32","value": "1"}, {"type": "UInt32","value": "2"}]'
